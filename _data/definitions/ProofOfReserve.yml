  A demonstration that an organization has access to all funds to which it claims ownership is called a Proof-of-Reserve. Cryptocurrencies based on a public ledger (blockchain) enable proofs of reserve to be conducted and publicly verified, although the term can also be applied to private audits intended to assure some audience that an organization is operating in good faith and not as a [fractional reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking)
