description: >
  An algorithm, program, or system used to produce arbitrary difficult-to-guess values for cryptographic applications. Typically [seeded](#seed) with some source of [entropy](#entropy), PRNGs are used, among other things, to generate [cryptographic keys](#key). Sometimes CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure PRNG). See related: [DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator)](#drbg).
