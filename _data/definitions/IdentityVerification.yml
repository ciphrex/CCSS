  Identity verification is a tiered process by which an organization or system attempts to confirm the authenticity of an [actors'](#actor) claim to be a given individual.
  Typical methods of identity verification include:  
  - one or more forms of government-issued identification (driver's license, passport, etc.)  
  - one or more proofs of residency at the individual's home (utility bills, bank statements, etc.)  
  - successful completion of challenge questions through a reputable identity-verification service operating in the individual's country of residence (e.g. Equifax)
