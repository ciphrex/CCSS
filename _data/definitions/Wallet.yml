description: >
  In the context of most cryptocurrencies, a wallet is a public-private keypair, where some encoding of the public key (an [address](#address)) can be used in transaction outputs to transfer funds. The private key can then be used to generate a valid signature for a transaction spending those funds.
  In practice, however, 'wallet' usually refers to an application that manages a large number of these keypairs, allowing a new address to be used for each transactions. Wallet applications generally fall into one of two categories:  
    -  JBOK (Just a Bunch of Keys) Wallets where the wallet uses a [PRNG](#prng) to generate each keypair and stores them for use.  
    -  [HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallets](#hd-wallet) which derives an arbitrary number of keypairs from one random [seed](#seed).

  Wallet software can introduce additional complexity, for example by combining multiple keypairs into single addresses, as in the case of a [multi-signature](#multisig) wallet.

  For the purposes of this document, the term 'wallet' refers to some *collection* of cryptocurrency [addresses](#address).
